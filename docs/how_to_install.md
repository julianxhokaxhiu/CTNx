# How-to: Install

Independently of the way you decide to install CTNx, in order to use it you MUST have a legal copy of the game. Support will NOT be provided if the game will NOT be detected as genuine.

## Canary vs Stable

CTNx comes in two flavors, resembling the Google Chrome release names. Unlike this one though, we don't need all the others.

- **Stable:** this is a fully tested, and hopefully, bug free release.
  > It is commonly accepted for long gameplay sessions and generic users. If in doubt, use this one first.
- **Canary:** this is like a nightly release, but untested. Feel free to use it at your own risk.
  > This is what users need to try before reporting any issue encountered in this channel, or if you want to try the latest development updates going on in CTNx.
